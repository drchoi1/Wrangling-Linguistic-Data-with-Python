Especially if , as in this case , the lead role is not yet cast ( it 's a hellishly difficult sing , and the intended singer pulled out just before musical rehearsals began . He is a consummate professional , so he must have had very solid reasons , but that still leaves other colleagues ( luckily not me : the role I am covering is not so big ) a bit adrift in a piece which requires long dialogues with the lead ...

It was based on data from the Netherlands , France and Sweden , countries which have varying levels of dairy products intake in the population . <p> Study co-author Professor Ren Rizzoli , Professor of Medicine and Head of the Division of Bone Disease at the University Hospitals of Geneva , said , " Despite the fact that the effects of foods on health are recognized , there are no accepted and proven methodologies to assess the health-economic impacts of foods on the general population . Although this model may be further refined , it does provide a straightforward and easy-to-use method to assess the health-economic impact of food products on health , well-being and costs .

@@5108441 <p> The current business model for business books is broken , Osterwalder said . There are too many books and too few readers . Every year , another 11,000 new business books pile on top the 250,000-space of competing titles . The average book sells only 250 copies per year . Worse , book sales are declining : a 12% drop from 2007 to 2009 . If Osterwalder wanted to create a book on business models that people would love to buy , he would need to innovate the business model for business book production and sales . <p> From the start , Osterwalder asked people what they hated about current business books . People said existing books were too fat with turgid prose but at the same time too light on substance . Second , people found the books impractical because they lacked useful " Monday morning " actions items . Finally , the books were too text-heavy , missing the richer , reinforcing learning experience of a text-and-graphics combination . <p> To address these problems , Osterwalder envisioned something more like a coffee-table book akin to architecture books , being simultaneously informative and beautiful . <p> Osterwalder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the rules of traditional business books to publish his book . At the time , Osterwalder was an unknown author from Switzerland wanting to create a book with high production values , expensive color printing , and a very un-business-book approach . The only solution was self-publishing . <p> But , self-publishing would n't be easy because Osterwalder had neither the cash , book production resources ( editors , designers , etc. ) , marketing department , nor distribution assets of a publishing house . <p> To solve the problem , Osterwalder recruited peers to co-create the book . Ultimately , 470 people contributed to the book in a wide variety of ways . People joined Osterwalder for early access to the ideas , to be part of something bigger , and for the stimulating collaborative process of working on the topic . Not only did this community of contributors help make the book , but they were also its best sales force . <p> To raise money , Osterwalder offered advanced sales under a " pay me now to reserve a copy " philosophy . Demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price from $24 to $36 to $54 to $81 . And , just before publication , he offered a last-minute premium deal : for $250 , the buyer would be listed in the book as a contributor who helped make it happen . For distribution , Osterwalder ultimately chose Fulfillment by Amazon . <p> The book quickly became a bestseller in business and in the top 100 of all books selling on Amazon . Osterwalder 's success in self-publishing attracted the attention of Wiley and other traditional publishers , who would never have taken a risk on Osterwalder 's book . " Once you 're successful , everyone wants in , " Osterwalder said . After tough negotiations , he signed with Wiley .

It 's an American story . When you get lemons , you make lemonade . And when you 're left with a shard of hard baked dough after gobbling though the cheese , sauce and toppings , you turn that crust into a fatty flavor wand of delight . <p> On Election Day , Papa John 's CEO John Schnatter got the equivalent of a stale crust . His man , Mitt Romney , lost and with him the hope of repealing Obamacare , bete noire of much of the food industry , from Applebees to Darden . But instead of dipping sauce , he applied a rank remoulade of threats , scaremongering and cultural tone-deafness . Warning of price hikes and scaling back workers ' hours , he said , " That 's what you do , is you pass on costs . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to pay for this . " <p> Well , then tell us , Mr. Schnatter . Oh wait , you already did . Back in the summer , you told us Obamacare will add $5 million to $8 million in expenses ( that 's less than 1% current operating expenses ) . And you said those costs would be passed on to consumers in form of a 10-to-14-cent price hike on pizzas . Check this Forbes.com article for a thorough look at the math . <p> So here 's the proposition as I understand it : We pay an extra dime and a few pennies per pizza so that your employees can see a doctor when they get sick . My response is : Deal ! <p> Maybe Mr. Schnatter , who 's been both praised and pilloried for his position , was on to something here .

But what about giving real visibility into components of a price , pulling back the curtains so we can see what we 're actually paying for when we fork over our money ? This is n't just corporate social responsibility hooey . It 's a short leap from what 's become a real trend : talking about supply-chain issues in brand communications . Think about Chipotle 's " Back to the Start , " one of the most lauded and popular campaigns in recent memory -- and it 's all about where the burrito chain 's ingredients come from .

But rather than gripe about them , he 'll explain why those are being passed along and what they mean . <p> Done right , the CEO becomes a sort of hero , who 's doing right by his workforce . <p> Does n't this sound better

And what 's the deal with Faraci 's enemity of movies with more free form type of narratives ? Does he think that the only type of narrative that matters is where things happen by going A to B to C ? And self-indulgence ? Most art IS self-indulgent , if you chose to see it that way . I mean , look at Bethoeven , he did n't give a fuck about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their private employees , Bethoeven composed for himself , and look at what he did ! He was being self-indulgence , you could say , but he create masterpieces of world music . I just do n't get this Faraci dude . What does he really want from movies ? " See , right there , you just summed up everything that 's wrong and shitty with mumblecore , and proved Devin and I right . Just cause it 's made outside of Hollywood , does n't mean shit . Even if it 's an Indie flick , you got ta have that special something . Indie/mumblecore flicks can be just as bad or shitty , for their own reasons , as much as Hollywood movies are . Devin does like alot of movies made outside of hollywood , if you actually read his articles , you 'd realize that . Are you fucking serious ? You really think the next Kubrick will come from mumblecore ? Wow . Not only does that win for dumbest fucking thing I 've heard in a while , but I hope you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely laughed at and humiliated . You do n't write like seriously or professionally when it comes to this do you ? Once again , if you actually read Devins writings , or anyones when it comes to this thing , no one is opposed to free form narratives . In fact , I think more people are in favor it . However , if you ca n't make it work , then just that . You ca n't make it work . And while yes , some/most art may be self indulgent , different people have different likes , and one can sometimes only take so much , and what you like , someone else may see as shit . You 're really comparing the mumblecore centric filmmakers and audiences to Behtoven ? Speaks for it 's self folks . <p> Anyone give me a rundown of what this genre is ? I 've seen it posed to the Duplass brother 's movies , but I thought those were fairly funny , low-key little dramedies ( Except for the horror one , Baghead . That movie SUCKED . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Who Lives at Home and Cyrus ) count as mumblecore or is it only low-budget , indie movies with the shaky-cam aesthetic ? <p> Anyone give me a rundown of what this genre is ? I 've seen it posed to the Duplass brother 's movies , but I thought those were fairly funny , low-key little dramedies ( Except for the horror one , Baghead . That movie SUCKED . ) Do the last Duplass movies that hit theaters ( Jeff , Who Lives at Home and Cyrus ) count as mumblecore or is it only low-budget , indie movies with the shaky-cam aesthetic ? <p> I like a lot of Devin 's writing and Badass Digest is head and shoulder above the slop that gets reported here , but he can definently be a prick sometimes , and even as somewhat of an admirer of the dude , I found some pleasure in seeing him get busted up a bit . <p> I like a lot of Devin 's writing and Badass Digest is head and shoulder above the slop that gets reported here , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat of an admirer of the dude , I found some pleasure in seeing him get busted up a bit . <p> I do n't know who that fat guy was but I hope he writes better than he fights . Maybe Demis Roussous should stick to singing , rather than boxing ! And I echo ginger muppet - I have NO idea who any of these douchebags are , what mumblycore is ( is that even a thing ? ! ? ) or what they are talking about . <p> Basically , I really dislike Faraci and I 've yet to figure out how a rude windbag from New York who lives in L.A. fits the vibe of the Alamo and/or Austin . I do n't believe Devin is half as smart as he obviously thinks he is , but I 'm not really part of the hipster bloggerati where foul language and puffed up opinion are considered good , original writing . <p> Neither do I really understand the whole idea of editor free rants of thousands of words slung on any topic ( ala Film Crit Hulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me banned from BAD . I also do n't completely understand how a blogger can steal the trademarked name and voice of a licensed Marvel Comics character to apply their shtick when it 's the very easily recognized name and voice that 's generating an instant readership to begin with . <p> None of that really matters , because generally speaking , it 's obvious that Film Crit Hulk is a smart guy who loves film and is n't a bad writer . I just had an opinion about a certain piece that I did n't like , and I was a bit of a wise ass about it . Devin , who is a wise ass about almost EVERYTHING , and throws blustery insults at everyone who disagrees with him , ca n't take the same being thrown in his direction in his " kingdom .

I liked all of them . Cold Weather and Cyrus both kicked ass . Jeff Who Lives at Home was alright . Entertaining but contrived . So I have no idea what Devin is whining about . <p> I still want to see someone debate him on his Batman Begins review , then kick his ass . None of his criticisms of that movie were valid .

Obsession with these type of things tends to stem from jealousy . He took a stab at Kevin Smith . Say what you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He is the biggest contrarian in film criticism since Armond White . I truly believe that he trashes films to get traffic to his site . If his taste is truly legitimate then he is one of the most ungrateful movie-goers of all time . <p> For all of his faults as a writer , at least Harry has enthusiasm .

Me , i 'll just keep watch and wait . <p> I did n't know what the hell it was until I watched this video which is somebody using clips of the films and listing characteristics . http : //www.youtu.be.com/watch ? v=9hiNC7uK ... <p> I have a few serious issues with this even being a genre . <p> Natural lighting : is never natural , looks like a soap opera or a porno . The fact is , yellow light bulbs work with our eyes , not on film . This is just lazy . <p> Seemingly no color correction . Again , lazy . If you force me to watch it , at least but a little color correction so the digital looks a little better and I do n't want to puke from all the yellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Black and White , which sidesteps the issue of color correction entirely ... until you realize it is the laziest incamera black and white you have ever seen . What 's wrong with a little sharpness , mates ? See Harmony Korine for effective use of " the video look " . <p> Shaky cam : All well and good . This is usually something that happens by accident anyways ; for me , and my pvc pipe shoulder mount , it happens often . This does not change the fact that if I had more money I would get a shoulder mount that works . It is difficult to maintain a stable shot . Shots that shake can add to the realism , or heighten action like in Crank . When they are willy nilly all over the place in a dialogue scene that is not intense , I say get a fucking tripod . The clips I saw on that video looked like the cameraman drank a lot of coffee , did not preplan his shot ( hence the zooming and unzooming ) and then the editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Von Trier for how to use a shaky camera while seeming like you know what you are doing . <p> Which brings me to : Spontaneous cutting , also known as lazy editing , also known as we were too stupid to film cutaways , or naturally end a scene or even worse we are attempting jump cuts and just failing and covering our tracks by making up this godforsakenly STUPID genre . See Godard . Look up " jump cut " . <p> The main reason why I hate it ? Because I make films , I know what is easy , what the easy ways out are . I know what my first films looked like and how I had to learn and learn to not make the mistakes that these films try to pass off as art . I know what lazy looks like because I 've done it a thousand times . Mumblecore is now retitled in my mind " Learnin ' Movies " . <p> I did n't know what the hell it was until I watched this video which is somebody using clips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v=9hiNC7uK ...
